Our readers for our own printf which to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c, s, %, d, i, b, u, o, x, X, S, non printable character, p, flag characters like +, space and #.
Length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: l and h,
field width for non-custom conversion specifiers,
0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers and
- flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Custom conversion specifier: r which prints the reversed string and R which prints the rot13'ed string.
